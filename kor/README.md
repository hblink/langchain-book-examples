# Kor Library: a Useful Library for using LLMs to extract data from text

The Kor library was written by Eugene Yurtsev. Kor is useful for using LLMs to extract structured data from unstructured text. Kor works by generating appropriate prompt text to explain to GPT-3.5 what information to extract and adding in the text to be processed.

The [GitHub repository for Kor](https://github.com/eyurtsev/kor) is under active development so please check the project for updates. Here is the [documentation](https://eyurtsev.github.io/kor/).
