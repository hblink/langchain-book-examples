# Multi-prompt Search using LLMs, the Duckduckgo search API, and local Ollama models


## install Duckduckgo search API library

docs:

https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-search/

    pip install duckduckgo_search_api

I believe the Duckduckgo search API can only be used for low volume non-commercial use. I find the results very useful because they are served from Duck Duck Go's internal quick-look data.

Also install:

    pip install llama-index html2text trafilatura
